# QE Technical Task

We would like you to write a working automated UI test suite in Javascript using either Cypress or CodeceptJS.  (or .NET equivalent if the role requires)

There are no trick questions; we want to see your solution with well thought-out, well structured code and rounded e2e tests.

## The task

On a public facing UK Government webpage 'Calculate your holiday entitlement', please write a working automated UI e2e test suite. If the language/framework you decide to use supports BDD/Gherkin, please use this syntax. An example feature file has been added to this repo.

You have autonomy on this task, the only remits are that you keep to the language and tools we have mentioned, that you provide a working solution and clear instructions on how to execute your solution.

We are looking for a demonstration of your technical skills, your ability to write a clear working solution that can be shared, and your 'tester mindset'.

## Time allocation

While there is no limit on the time you can spend on this task before the deadline we have requested. We do say you should not spend more then an a few hours completing this task. We are not asking for 1000's of tests, but we would like to see a good rounded selection. If time allows and you want too, please add in any thoughts of other testing you might do for a Public Sector application such as this one.

## Presenting/submitting your solution

Please create a new private Github repository in your own account, with your working solution and share this with us @QESolirius. This is so we can review your solution and we can keep it private. Please provide a thorough README.

## NB:

We are aware that the technical skill of QA professionals varies greatly. The test will be trivial for some and hard for others. As such not being able to complete the entire task doesn't mean your application won't be considered. However this is your chance to shine, please do aim to do your best work, and good luck!
